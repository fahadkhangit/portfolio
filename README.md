## About Me  

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On the one hand, I am organized, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a research chemist. On the other hand, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my Bachelor's Degree from the AIR University of Islamabad. Now, I wish to exploit my technical and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am working as a Senior SQA Engineer at OneStream Live (Finland), and I am responsible for testing web and mobile applications. My expertise includes Functional testing, API testing, and Cypress Automation test scripts development. I am also familiar with Performance and Database testing.

I am passionate about improving software quality. Crafting code logic, discovering critical bugs, and brainstorming innovative ways to enhance software quality are my driving forces. I am also eager to transition into an SDET role, where I can leverage my skills in test automation and CI/CD workflows to further contribute to the team's success.
